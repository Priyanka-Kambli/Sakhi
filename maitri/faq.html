        <h4>Are there any specific duties of an employer under law?</h4>
        <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          Yes. The law has provided for several duties of an employer. Some of
          them are: Provide a safe working environment at workplace which
          includes safety from persons coming into contact at workplace. Display
          at any conspicuous place in the workplace, the penal consequences of
          sexual harassment and the order constituting the Internal Committee
          (“IC“). Formulate and widely disseminate an internal policy for
          prohibition, prevention and redressal of sexual harassment. Declare
          the names and contact details of all the members of IC. Organize
          workshops and awareness programs at regular intervals for sensitizing
          employees. Organize orientation programs for IC members. Conduct
          capacity building and skill building programs for IC members. Carry
          out employees awareness programs and create forum for dialogue. Use
          modules developed by State Government to conduct workshops and
          awareness programs. You can read through to understand how you can
          comply with these duties. Needless to say, we are there to help you at
          each stage, if required.

        <h4>
          What happens if I do not fulfil the duties prescribed under law?
        </h4>
        <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          If you do not constitute the IC and fulfil the rest of the duties
          enshrined under the Act, there can be a penalty under the law which
          may extend to Rs. 50,000. In case of not fulfilling the duties
          repeatedly, the penalty can be doubled and in cases where one is
          required to obtain a license to do business, such license may be
          cancelled or an application for registration or renewal may be
          withdrawn and cancelled.

        <h4>What are the preventive steps I can take as an employer?</h4>
        <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          You can: Organize regular training programs for your IC members so
          that they are fully up to date on the law and the procedure. Organize
          awareness programs for employees on a time to time basis to keep them
          informed of their rights and duties and what may constitute sexual
          harassment. Organize sessions for management so that they can comply
          with the law effectively and take measures to prevent instances of
          sexual harassment and create a healthy work atmosphere. Have
          orientation programs for new joinees to inform them of your beliefs
          and policy. Have gender sensitization programs to instil the feeling
          of equality at workplace. This can go a long way in showing that you
          are an equal opportunity employer. Ensure that your IC meets on a
          regular basis to discuss issues and keep themselves updated. Provide
          your IC with all the facilities they require.

        <h4>Can I share details of a complaint on the POSH at Work website?</h4>
        <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          No. We request you not to display / share details of any matter of
          sexual harassment or the identities of the concerned persons, as this
          is a public forum. The law provides that any information related to a
          matter of sexual harassment cannot be published, communicated or made
          known to the public, press or media in any manner.
